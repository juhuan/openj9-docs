## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.53.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17, and 21.

RHEL 8.8 and 9.2 are out of support and are removed from the list of supported platforms. RHEL 8.10 and 9.4 are the new minimum operating system levels.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### OpenSSL support added for PBKDF2 algorithm

OpenSSL native cryptographic support is added for the Password based key derivation (PBKDF2) algorithm, providing improved cryptographic performance. OpenSSL support is enabled by default for the PBKDF2 algorithm. If you want to turn off support for the PBKDF2 algorithm, set the [`-Djdk.nativePBKDF2`](djdknativepbkdf2.md) system property to `false`.

### OpenSSL 3.5.1 is bundled on all platforms

OpenSSL 3.5.1 is now supported and bundled on all platforms. You can use the `jdk.native.openssl.skipBundled` property to specify whether to load the pre-packaged OpenSSL library or the library available on the system path.

For more information, see [OpenSSL](openssl.md).

### Offheap support is added for the `balanced` GC policy

Before the 0.53.0 release, the `balanced` GC policy used an arraylet representation in the heap to support large arrays that cannot be contained in a region. Now, if the array's data are larger than a region size, the data are stored into a separate area, Offheap.

For more information, see [GC processing](gc.md#balanced-policy).

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 11 (LTS) and later](cr/java11plus.png) New JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) events are added in this release

In this release, the following new JFR events are added:

- NativeLibrary (Linux&reg; only)
- SystemGC
- SystemProcess (Linux only)
- YoungGenerationConfiguration

For more information, see [`-XX:[+|-]FlightRecorder`](xxflightrecorder.md). ![End of content that applies only to Java 11 and later](cr/java_close.png)
