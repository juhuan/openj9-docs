# -XX:\[+|-\]HandleSIGUSR2

**(AIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, macOS&reg;, and z/OS&reg; only)**

This option affects the handling of the `SIGUSR2` signal. This signal is user-defined and triggers the [`user2`](xdump.md#dump-events) event, which is commonly used for taking system dump files with exclusive access. The operating system installs a default signal handler for handling `SIGUSR2`. If there is no VM or application signal handler, then the operating system's signal handler is used.


## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]HandleSIGAUSR2

| Setting               | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-----------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+HandleSIGUSR2` | Enable  | :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| `-XX:-HandleSIGUSR2` | Disable |                                                                                    |


## Explanation

When enabled, the VM handles the `SIGUSR2` signal and generates the `user2` event, which can be configured with the `-Xdump` option to trigger a dump agent.

When the option is disabled, the VM does not handle the `SIGUSR2` signal and therefore, the VM signal handler is not installed. Generally, the default operating system handler that is installed for the `SIGUSR2` signal takes over the handling of the signal.

For more information about the signals and signal handling, see [Signal handling](openj9_signals.md).

:fontawesome-solid-pencil:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** Do not use the `-XX:+HandleSIGUSR2` and [`-Xrs`](xrs.md) options together. An error is thrown if both options are enabled. To resolve this error, one of the options should be disabled.
