## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.40.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17 and 20.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### New `-XX:codecachetotalMaxRAMPercentage` option added

In environments with low physical memory availability, the VM might use too much memory for JIT code caches, leaving little memory for critical operations. With the `-XX:codecachetotalMaxRAMPercentage` option, you can set an upper limit for the total code cache size, where the upper limit is specified as a percentage of the physical memory the VM process is allowed to use.

For more information, see [`-XX:codecachetotalMaxRAMPercentage`](xxcodecachetotalmaxrampercentage.md).

### VM starts with a warning message after the container detection fails

If you mount the `/proc` file system with the `hidepid=2` option on LinuxÂ® systems and the VM does not have root privileges, it cannot access the `/proc` file system. In previous releases, the VM exits when it encounters this scenario. From this release, the VM starts with a warning message after the container detection fails.

For more information, see the [Cloud optimizations](introduction.md#cloud-optimizations) topic.

### Support for persistent shared classes cache added on z/OS

Persistent shared caches are now supported on z/OS systems. The default cache type on z/OS is still non-persistent. You can use the [`-Xshareclasses:persistent`](xshareclasses.md#persistent) option to switch to persistent shared cache.

### EC key generation algorithm and XDH key agreement and generation algorithms support for OpenSSL

The EC key generation algorithm can now use the native OpenSSL library for all OpenJDK versions.![Start of content that applies to Java 11 (LTS) and later](cr/java11plus.png) The XDH key agreement and generation algorithms can also use the native OpenSSL library.![End of content that applies to Java 11 (LTS) and later](cr/java_close_lts.png) For more information, see [`-Djdk.nativeECKeyGen`](djdknativeeckeygen.md), [`-Djdk.nativeXDHKeyAgreement`](djdknativexdhkeyagreement.md), and [`-Djdk.nativeXDHKeyGen`](djdknativexdhkeygen.md).
