# -XX:\[+|-\]OpenJ9CommandLineEnv

This option controls whether the VM captures the command line in the environment variable `OPENJ9_JAVA_COMMAND_LINE`. If enabled, the variable is set by the VM after it starts. Using this variable, you can find the command-line parameters set when the VM started. It applies not just to launchers (e.g. `java`) that are included in a JDK, but to any application that uses `JNI_CreateJavaVM()`.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]OpenJ9CommandLineEnv

| `-XX:-OpenJ9CommandLineEnv` | Disable | :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |                                                                                      |

This option is currently disabled by default on z/OS&reg; because it might cause the VM to crash.
