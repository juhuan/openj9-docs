## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.56.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17, 21, and 25.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### Change in the `getCpuLoad()` method return value based on the platform

In all platforms except z/OS&reg;, if the `-XX:+CpuLoadCompatibility` option is set to enable the OpenJDK behavior of the `getProcessCpuLoad()` and `getCpuLoad()` methods in OpenJ9, the `getCpuLoad()` method now collects two internal samples so that a valid CPU usage value can be returned instead of `0` return value on the first call.

On z/OS, the CPU load that is reported by the `getCpuLoad` method is obtained directly from the system control blocks, without the need to collect samples. The `-XX:[+|-]CpuLoadCompatibility` option has no effect on z/OS, and a valid CPU usage value is always returned whatever be the setting of this option.

For more information, see [`-XX:[+|-]CpuLoadCompatibility`](xxcpuloadcompatibility.md).

### New `-Xgc` parameters related to macro fragmentation added

New parameters, `enableEstimateFragmentation` and `disableEstimateFragmentation` are added to the `-Xgc` option. You can use these options to control the calculating and reporting of the estimates of the macro fragmentation, as reported by verbose garbage collection (GC) at the end of Scavenge GCs.

For more information, see [`-Xgc`](xgc.md#disableestimatefragmentation).

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 11 (LTS) and later](cr/java11plus.png) The NativeLibrary and SystemProcess JFR events are supported in all platforms except z/OS

From this release onwards, the NativeLibrary and SystemProcess JFR events are supported in all platforms except z/OS. Earlier, these JFR events were supported only in Linux&reg;.

To record and analyze the SystemProcess JFR event on z/OS (2.5 and 3.1), you must install [APAR OA62757](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/apar/OA62757).

For more information, see [`-XX:[+|-]FlightRecorder`](xxflightrecorder.md). ![End of content that applies only to Java 11 and later](cr/java_close_lts.png)
