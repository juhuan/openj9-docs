# -XX:[+|-]ShowNativeStackSymbols

This option controls whether Java&reg; dumps show the names of functions in native call stacks.

## Syntax

        -XX:-ShowNativeStackSymbols
        -XX:+ShowNativeStackSymbols=<value>

| Setting                    | Value  | Effect | Default |
|----------------------------|--------|------|:-------:|
| `-XX:-ShowNativeStackSymbols` |       | Don't show native stack symbols, not even in response to a signal, such as a fault signal      |   |
| `-XX:+ShowNativeStackSymbols` | basic | Show all the available native stack symbols for a signaled or faulting thread, but only easily acquired native stack symbols for other threads     | :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| `-XX:+ShowNativeStackSymbols` | all | Show all the available native stack symbols for all threads     |   |

## Explanation

Java dumps take longer to produce when the native stack symbols are included. If your Java application has a lot of threads, you might get an incomplete Java dump. You can avoid this situation by reducing the number of native stack symbols in the Java dump or by omitting them altogether.
