# -XX:[+|-]CpuLoadCompatibility

This option enables or disables the OpenJDK behavior of the `getProcessCpuLoad()` and `getCpuLoad()` methods in OpenJ9.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** Before OpenJDK 14, the `getCpuLoad()` method name was `getSystemCpuLoad()`. Because OpenJDK 14 is no longer supported, the relevant LTS release where this change is visible is OpenJDK 17 and later.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]CpuLoadCompatibility

| Setting               | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-----------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+CpuLoadCompatibility` |  Enable   |                             |
| `-XX:-CpuLoadCompatibility` |  Disable  |   :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span>         |

## Explanation

The `getProcessCpuLoad()` method in the `com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean` class returns the recent CPU usage value for the Java virtual machine process, while the `getCpuLoad()` method returns the recent CPU usage value for the whole system. When these methods were called in OpenJ9 for the first time, these methods were returning `-1` to indicate that the recent CPU usage is not available. It was difficult to identify whether the reason for the `-1` value was an error or because the call was the first call and therefore, no recent CPU usage was available.

In OpenJDK, `getProcessCpuLoad()` returns `0` value on the first call, while `getCpuLoad()` collects two internal samples so that a valid CPU usage value can be returned. This `0` return value on the first call and the two internal samples make it easier to differentiate between the first call behavior and an error that needs further investigation.

The `-XX:+CpuLoadCompatibility` option is used to enable the OpenJDK behavior of the `getProcessCpuLoad()` and `getCpuLoad()` methods in OpenJ9.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** The `-XX:[+|-]CpuLoadCompatibility` option is applicable to all platforms except z/OS&reg;. On z/OS, the CPU load that is reported by the `getCpuLoad` method is obtained directly from the system control blocks, without the need to collect samples. The `-XX:[+|-]CpuLoadCompatibility` option has no effect on z/OS, and a valid CPU usage value is always returned whatever be the setting of this option.
