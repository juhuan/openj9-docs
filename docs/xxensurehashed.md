# -XX:\[+|-\]EnsureHashed

This option specifies classes to be pre-hashed. Objects that are created from these classes are hashed and extended with a slot to store the assigned hash value when the object is created or first moved during the garbage collection process. This option might improve performance for applications that frequently hash objects of a certain type.

## Syntax

        -XX:+EnsureHashed:<classes>
        -XX:-EnsureHashed:<classes>

| Setting                     | Effect           |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| `-XX:+EnsureHashed:<classes>` | Specify classes  |
| `-XX:-EnsureHashed:<classes>` | Ignore classes |

Where `<classes>` is a comma-separated list of fully qualified class names, for example, `java/lang/String`.

## Explanation

The `-XX:+EnsureHashed:<classes>` option specifies the classes and the `-XX:-EnsureHashed:<classes>` option ignores classes that were previously specified. These options are parsed left to right.

For example, `-XX:+EnsureHashed:Class1,Class2,Class3 -XX:-EnsureHashed:Class2 -XX:+EnsureHashed:Class2,Class4 -XX:-EnsureHashed:Class1,Class3` results in the set of `EnsureHashed` classes {`Class2`, `Class4`}.

Objects that are created from classes `Thread` and `Class` are allocated in the tenure region directly and therefore, do not get moved by the garbage collector often. It takes time for such pre-tenured objects to get hashed and extended with a slot. To pre-hash those objects from the start and hence, improve the performance,`-XX:+EnsureHashed:java/lang/Class,java/lang/Thread` is added to the list of default options in the `options.default` file.
