# ‑Xenableexcessivegc / ‑Xdisableexcessivegc

These options enable or disable the throwing of an `OutOfMemory` exception if excessive time is spent in the GC.

If excessive time is spent in the GC, the option returns `null` for an allocate request and thus causes an `OutOfMemory` exception to be thrown.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** The `OutOfMemory` exception is thrown only when the heap has been fully expanded and the percentage of application run time that is spent in garbage collection is at least 95%. This percentage is the default value that triggers an excessive GC event. You can control this value with the [`-Xgc:excessiveGCratio`](xgc.md#excessivegcratio) option.

These options can be used with all Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; GC policies.
