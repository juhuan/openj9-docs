# What's new in version 0.39.0

The following new features and notable changes since version 0.38.0 are included in this release:

- [New binaries and changes to supported environments](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [EC key generation algorithm support for OpenSSL](#ec-key-generation-algorithm-support-for-openssl)
- [New JDK 20 features](#new-jdk-20-features)

## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.39.0 supports OpenJDK 20.

OpenJDK 20 with Eclipse OpenJ9 is *not* a long term support (LTS) release.

RHEL 8.4 is out of support. RHEL 8.6 is the new minimum operating system level.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### EC key generation algorithm support for OpenSSL

The EC key generation algorithm can now use the native OpenSSL library for OpenJDK 20. For more information, see [`-Djdk.nativeECKeyGen`](djdknativeeckeygen.md).

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 20 plus](cr/java20plus.png) New JDK 20 features

The following features are supported by OpenJ9:

- [JEP 434](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/434): Foreign Function & Memory API (Second Preview)
- [JEP 436](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/436): Virtual Threads (Second Preview)
- [JEP 437](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/437): Structured Concurrency (Second Incubator)
- [JEP 438](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/438): Vector API (Fifth Incubator)

The following features are implemented in OpenJDK and available in any build of OpenJDK 20 with OpenJ9:

- [JEP 432](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/432): Record Patterns (Second Preview)
- [JEP 433](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/433): Pattern Matching for switch (Fourth Preview)

You can find the full list of features for JDK 20 at the [OpenJDK project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/20/).
Any remaining features that are listed either do not apply to OpenJ9 or are not implemented and hence not applicable to OpenJ9 in this release.
