# -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.retry

**Windows&trade; only**

This option specifies the number of times the `jcmd` tool retries attaching to a running VM when the tool encounters the `SocketException` error.

## Syntax

        -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.retry=<number_of_retries>

The default value for `<number_of_retries>` is 3.

## Explanation

When the `jcmd` tool sends a command to a running VM, the command might throw the `Socket Exception` error in case of issues, such as a network failure or a connection reset. Instead of failing the attaching request, you can specify the number of times the tool retries attaching to the target VM with the `-Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.retry` system property.
