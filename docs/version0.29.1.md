:fontawesome-solid-pencil:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** Applications might be adversely affected by JEP 403
if they make use of internal APIs. You should update your application to use standard APIs. To temporarily work around
this problem, use `--add-opens`, `--add-exports` on the command line for each package required.
