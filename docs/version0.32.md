## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.32.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17, and 18.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### Creation of system dumps on macOS&reg; 12

You can now create system (core) dumps on macOS 12 or later.


### Support for OpenJDK HotSpot options

For compatibility, the following OpenJDK HotSpot options are now supported by OpenJ9:

- [`-XX:[+|-]ShowHiddenFrames`](xxshowhiddenframes.md). This option specifies whether generated hidden `MethodHandle` frames are displayed in a stack trace.

### `SharedClassStatistics` API updated

You can now use the `SharedClassStatistics` API to get the name, path, and directory of a shared classes cache. Depending on the operating system, you can also get the number of attached VMs for a non-persistent cache. This information is available through the following new methods: `cacheDir()`, `cacheName()`, `cachePath()`, and `numberAttached()`. For more information, see the API documentation.

### Support for OpenSSL 3.0.x

OpenSSL 3.0.x is supported but on Linux only. The JITServer technology feature currently does not support OpenSSL 3.0.x. For more information about OpenSSL support, see [`Cryptographic operations`](introduction.md#cryptographic-operations).

### New `-XX:[+|-]OpenJ9CommandLineEnv` option added

This option specifies whether the VM captures the command line in the environment variable `OPENJ9_JAVA_COMMAND_LINE`. For more information, see [`-XX:[+|-]OpenJ9CommandLineEnv`](xxopenj9commandlineenv.md).

### JITServer support for Linux on IBM Z&reg; systems
JITServer technology is now a fully supported feature on Linux on IBM Z&reg; systems (64-bit only). For more information, see [JITServer technology](jitserver.md).

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 11 plus](cr/java11plus.png) Modified default value for `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize`

The default value of the [`-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize`](xxmaxdirectmemorysize.md) option, which limits the amount of heap memory that is used for direct byte buffers, is now the same as the maximum heap size.

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 18 plus](cr/java18plus.png) New JDK 18 features

The following features are supported by OpenJ9:

- [JEP 400](https://openjdk.org/jeps/400): UTF-8 by Default
- [JEP 416](https://openjdk.org/jeps/416): Reimplement Core Reflection with Method Handles
- [JEP 421](https://openjdk.org/jeps/421): Deprecate Finalization for Removal

The following features will be supported by OpenJ9 in a future release:

- [JEP 391](https://openjdk.org/jeps/391): macOS/AArch64 Port
    - An early access build is available in this release
- [JEP 417](https://openjdk.org/jeps/417): Vector API (Third Incubator)
- [JEP 419](https://openjdk.org/jeps/419): Foreign Function & Memory API (Second Incubator)

The following features are implemented in OpenJDK and available in any build of OpenJDK 18 with OpenJ9:

- [JEP 408](https://openjdk.org/jeps/408): Simple Web Server
- [JEP 413](https://openjdk.org/jeps/413): Code Snippets in Java API Documentation
- [JEP 418](https://openjdk.org/jeps/418): Internet-Address Resolution SPI
- [JEP 420](https://openjdk.org/jeps/420): Pattern Matching for switch (Second Preview)
