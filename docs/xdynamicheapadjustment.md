# -XdynamicHeapAdjustment

**Linux&reg; on x86, Linux on IBM Power&reg; systems, Linux on AArch64 and Linux on IBM Z&reg; systems (64-bit only)**

![Java 11 (LTS) and later](docs/cr/java11plus.png) This option enables a VM capability that automatically adjusts the maximum Java heap size ([`-Xmx`](xms.md)) and minimum Java heap size ([`-Xms`](xms.md)) values such that they are within the physical memory limitations on the system.

## Syntax

        -XdynamicHeapAdjustment

The option is disabled by default. After it is enabled, the option cannot be disabled.

## Explanation

Large `-Xmx` or `-Xms` values can cause problems or errors. If the `-Xmx` value is set larger than the available memory, errors, such as Out of memory error, excessive paging, or a bus error, might occur. If the `-Xms` value is set larger than the available memory or the soft maximum size of the cache ([`-Xsoftmx`](xsoftmx.md)), an unrecoverable error occurs.

The `-XdynamicHeapAdjustment` option can be used to auto adjust the system, and avoid potential problems because of too large `-Xmx` or `-Xms` values. If the `-Xmx` or `-Xms` values are specified together with the `-XdynamicHeapAdjustment` option, VM automatically picks a size for `-Xmx` and `-Xms` that is within the limits of the available memory on the system. Typically, this size is 75% of the available memory.

For example, if the system has 8 GB memory but `-Xmx` is set to 12 GB, then the VM sets the value of `xsoftmx`, 6 GB, as the default maximum size of the heap.

- You can specify the `-XdynamicHeapAdjustment` option only at checkpoint time, and it applies to both checkpoint and restore.
- The `-XdynamicHeapAdjustment` option can be used only with the `-XX:+EnableCRIUSuport` option.
