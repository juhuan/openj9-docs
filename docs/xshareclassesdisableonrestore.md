# -Xshareclasses:disableOnRestore

**(Linux&reg; x86, Linux on POWER&reg; (Little Endian), Linux on AArch64, and Linux on IBM Z&reg; only)**

The `-Xshareclasses` option is an existing option and `disableOnRestore` is its new parameter that can be used if the CRIU feature is available. This option is disabled by default.

:fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation:{: .warn aria-hidden="true"} **Restrictions:**

- This option takes effect only when the `-XX:+EnableCRIUSupport` option is enabled.
- This option can be used only on restore.

## Parameters

### `disableOnRestore`

        -Xshareclasses:disableOnRestore

The `-Xshareclasses:disableOnRestore` option disables further use of the shared classes cache (SCC) on restore. You can still use the [shared classes utility APIs](shrc.md#the-java-shared-classes-utility-api), for example, to obtain metrics about the shared cache.

The `-Xshareclasses:disableOnRestore` option is similar to the existing [`-Xshareclasses:none`](xshareclasses.md#none) option but with the following differences:

- The `-Xshareclasses:none` option turns off the cache on the VM startup but the `-Xshareclasses:disableOnRestore` option turns off the cache on restore. If you turn off the cache on startup, then specifying the `-Xshareclasses:disableOnRestore` option has no impact because there is no cache existing in the checkpoint image for the option to disable.
- The `-Xshareclasses:none` option disables the shared classes utility APIs but the `-Xshareclasses:disableOnRestore` option keeps the utility APIs working.
