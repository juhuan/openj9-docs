## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.47.0 supports OpenJDK 23.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### `-Xshareclasses` option automatically enables `-XX:+ShareOrphans`

The `-XX:+ShareOrphans` option automatically enables the `-Xshareclasses` option. From release 0.47.0 onwards, if the `-Xshareclasses` option is specified in the command line, it automatically enables the `-XX:+ShareOrphans` option.

For more information, see [`-XX:[+|-]ShareOrphans`](xxshareorphans.md).

### Restrictions in the `-XX:[+|-]ShareOrphans` option fixed

The `-XX:[+|-]ShareOrphans` option had the following restrictions:

- The class comparison might not detect the removal of method access modifiers. For example, a change of a method from public to package-private.
- `java.lang.StackTraceElement.getClassLoaderName()` might return null for classes that are stored in the shared cache.

These restrictions are no longer applicable from this release onwards.

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 23 and later](cr/java23plus.png) New JDK 23 features

- [JEP 481](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/481): Scoped Values (Third Preview)

The following features are implemented in OpenJDK and available in any build of OpenJDK 23 with OpenJ9:

- [JEP 455](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/455): Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Preview)
- [JEP 466](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/466): Class-File API (Second Preview)
- [JEP 467](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/467): Markdown Documentation Comments

You can find the full list of features for JDK 23 at the [OpenJDK project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/23/).
Any remaining features that are listed either do not apply to OpenJ9 or are not implemented and hence not applicable to OpenJ9 in this release. ![End of content that applies to Java 23 and later](cr/java_close.png)
