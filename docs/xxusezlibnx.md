# -XX:\[+|-\]UseZlibNX

**AIX&reg; with IBM POWER9&reg; and later only**

This option enables or disables the adding of the `zlibNX` library directory location to the `LIBPATH` environment variable.


## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]UseZlibNX

| Setting               | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-----------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+UseZlibNX` |  Enable  |           |
| `-XX:-UseZlibNX` | Disable |   :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span>   |


## Explanation

AIX system adds the `zlibNX` library location, if available, to the `LIBPATH` variable by default. But having the `zlibNX` library directory location in the `LIBPATH` variable might cause some issues. For example, Git clone fails when executed from Java&reg; when `zlibNX` is on the `LIBPATH` in the environment.

You can enable adding of the `zlibNX` library location to the `LIBPATH` variable with the `-XX:+UseZlibNX` option.
